Step 1.2: Async and isolates
============================

**Estimated time**: 1 day

The nowadays digital world would be impossible without the concept of [multitasking][101] (imagine a [server][102] that can process only a single request at the same time, or an [operating system][103] that is able to run only a single program). [Multitasking][101] comes in many forms, but it's always about [concurrent][104] execution of multiple tasks, bound by some limited in time resource. The most common and practical dichotomy of such possible resources is:
- [CPU-bound] problems, where the time to complete a task is determined principally **by the speed of the [CPU]** (for example, neural networks computations, cryptographic algorithms, video encoding/rendering, etc).
- [I/O-bound] problems, where the time to complete a task is determined principally **by the period spent waiting for [I/O operations] to be completed** (for example, accessing database, sending HTTP request, reading a file, etc).

For [CPU-bound] problems the most traditional tools for organizing [multitasking][101] are: 
- [Multithreading][114], which allow scheduling new tasks (called "[threads][106]"), attached by an [operating system][103] to different [CPU] cores, and managed in [preemptive][107] manner.
- [SIMD] instructions, which allow to execute the same [CPU] operation for multiple elements at the same time (as a single [CPU] instruction).

For [I/O-bound] problems the most traditional tool for organizing [multitasking][101] is [asynchronous programming][109], which utilizes [non-blocking I/O operations][110] to omit blocking the [thread][106] the tasks are executing on, and comes with an asynchronous runtime (either [preemptive][107] or [cooperative][108]), providing an [event loop][111] for executing and driving tasks to completion, wrapped into usable asynchronous abstractions (such as [futures][112] or [coroutines][113]).

Another useful dichotomy for [multitasking][101] is:
- [Concurrency][104], which is about multiple tasks **making progress at the same time**.
- [Parallelism][115], which is about multiple tasks **running at the same time**.

## Async

[Dart] provides a [first-class support][202] for [asynchronous programming][109] in form of [futures][112] and [`async`/`await`][201]. 

> Dart libraries are full of functions that return [`Future`] or [`Stream`] objects. These functions are asynchronous: they return after setting up a possibly time-consuming operation (such as I/O), without waiting for that operation to complete.
>
> The `async` and `await` keywords support asynchronous programming, letting you write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code.

> To use `await`, code must be in an async function â€” a function marked as `async`:
> ```dart
> Future<void> checkVersion() async {
>   var version = await lookUpVersion();
>   // Do something with version
> }
> ```

**[`Stream`] represents a sequence of [`Future`]s**:
> A stream is a sequence of asynchronous events. It is like an asynchronous `Iterable` - where, instead of getting the next event when you ask for it, the stream tells you that there is an event when it is ready.

```dart
import 'dart:async';

void main() {
  // Creating a stream controller
  StreamController<int> controller = StreamController<int>();

  // Creating a stream from the stream controller
  Stream<int> stream = controller.stream;

  // Subscribing to the stream
  StreamSubscription<int> subscription = stream.listen(
    (int value) {
      print('Received: $value');
    },
    onError: (error) {
      print('Error occurred: $error');
    },
    onDone: () {
      print('Stream is done');
    },
  );

  // Adding values to the stream
  controller.sink.add(1);
  controller.sink.add(2);
  controller.sink.add(3);

  // Closing the stream
  controller.close();

  // Canceling the subscription
  subscription.cancel();
}
```

Another important and widely used asynchronous abstraction in [Dart] is a [`Timer`]:
> A countdown timer that can be configured to fire once or repeatedly.

```dart
import 'dart:async';

void main() {
  print('Start');
  
  Timer(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
    print('Two seconds have passed!');
  });
  
  print('End');
}
```

## Isolates

[Dart] supports [multithreading][114] in form of [`Isolate`]s. They are intentionally named this way to emphasize that **multiple [`Isolate`]s do not share any memory**, unlike traditional mechanisms ([pthreads] ([POSIX] threads), [OpenMP], etc) requiring a [multithread synchronization][301], but rather communicate via [message passing][302].

> Within an app, all Dart code runs in an isolate. Each Dart isolate has a single thread of execution and shares no mutable objects with other isolates. To communicate with each other, isolates use message passing. Many Dart apps use only one isolate, the main isolate. You can create additional isolates to enable parallel code execution on multiple processor cores.

> Instead of threads, all Dart code runs inside of isolates. Each isolate has its own memory heap, ensuring that none of the state in an isolate is accessible from any other isolate. Because thereâ€™s no shared memory, you donâ€™t have to worry about [mutexes or locks][303].
>
> Using isolates, your Dart code can perform multiple independent tasks at once, using additional processor cores if theyâ€™re available. Isolates are like threads or processes, but each isolate has its own memory and a single thread running an event loop.

## Task

- [`task_1.dart`](task_1.dart): make the `Chat.read` method to invoke the `Chat.onRead` callback debounced.
- [`task_2.dart`](task_2.dart): implement the `Client.connect` method re-connecting to a server using a [backoff algorithm][401].
- [`task_3.dart`](task_3.dart): implement an [`HttpServer`] writing to a `dummy.txt` file on any of its routes and returning its contents (reading from it) on another. Note, that `dummy.txt` might not exist when trying to read from it, server should respond with an error in such case.
- [`task_4.dart`](task_4.dart): implement an algorithm calculating sum of prime numbers from 1 to N using [`Isolate`]s.

## Answers

**Q: What is multitasking? Why it exists? How is it used for solving CPU-bound and I/O-bound problems?**

Multitasking is the ability to execute multiple tasks concurrently, making better use of system resources. It exists because single-threaded execution is inefficient - while one task waits for I/O, the CPU sits idle.

For CPU-bound problems (like mathematical calculations), multitasking uses multiple threads/cores to parallelize computation. For I/O-bound problems (like network requests), it allows other tasks to run while waiting for slow operations to complete, preventing the entire program from blocking.

**Q: What is preemptive multitasking? What is cooperative multitasking? Which one is used in Dart?**

Preemptive multitasking: The OS forcibly switches between tasks at regular intervals, ensuring no single task can monopolize the CPU.

Cooperative multitasking: Tasks voluntarily yield control to other tasks. If a task doesn't yield, it can block everything.

Dart uses cooperative multitasking within isolates through its event loop. Tasks must yield control by using `await` or completing synchronously. Between isolates, Dart uses preemptive multitasking managed by the OS.

**Q: What is asynchronous programming and when do we need it? How is it represented in Dart?**

Asynchronous programming allows code to start long-running operations without blocking the current thread. We need it for I/O operations like file reading, network requests, or user interactions.

In Dart, it's represented through:
- `Future<T>` for single async operations
- `async`/`await` keywords for writing async code that looks synchronous
- `Stream<T>` for sequences of async events

**Q: What is a Stream and how this abstraction is useful? Give some real-world examples.**

A Stream represents a sequence of asynchronous events over time. It's useful because many real-world scenarios involve continuous data flow rather than single values.

Real-world examples:
- User input events (button clicks, keyboard input)
- File reading in chunks
- WebSocket connections receiving messages
- Sensor data (GPS coordinates, accelerometer readings)
- Database change notifications

**Q: What is a Timer and how this abstraction is useful? Give some real-world examples of using it.**

A Timer allows scheduling code execution after a delay or at regular intervals. It's useful for time-based operations without blocking the main thread.

Real-world examples:
- Auto-save functionality every few minutes
- Periodic API polling for updates
- Animation frame updates
- Session timeout warnings
- Debouncing user input (wait for user to stop typing)
- Retry mechanisms with delays

**Q: How does Dart handle multiple Isolates? How do they communicate? How to share memory?**

Dart isolates are completely isolated from each other - they cannot share memory directly. Each isolate has its own heap and memory space.

Communication happens through message passing:
- `SendPort` and `ReceivePort` for sending/receiving messages
- Messages are copied between isolates (serialized/deserialized)
- Only specific types can be sent (primitives, lists, maps, etc.)

You cannot share memory between isolates - this is by design to avoid synchronization issues.

**Q: How are Isolate.spawn and Isolate.spawnUri different?**

`Isolate.spawn()`: Creates a new isolate running a specific function from the current program. The function must be a top-level function or static method.

`Isolate.spawnUri()`: Creates a new isolate running code from a separate Dart file/script. Useful for running completely separate programs or when you need different entry points.

**Q: What is concurrency vs parallelism? How are both represented in Dart?**

Concurrency: Multiple tasks making progress by interleaving execution (appears simultaneous but may run on single core).

Parallelism: Multiple tasks actually running simultaneously on different cores.

In Dart:
- Concurrency: Single isolate with async/await, Streams, and event loop
- Parallelism: Multiple isolates running on different OS threads/cores
- A single isolate can be concurrent but not parallel
- Multiple isolates enable true parallelism
