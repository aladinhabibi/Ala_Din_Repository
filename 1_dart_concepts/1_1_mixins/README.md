Step 1.1: Mixins and extensions
===============================

**Estimated time**: 1 day




## Extensions

[Extension methods][11] is a vital concept in [Dart], allowing to add functionality to existing types in foreign libraries.

> For example, hereâ€™s how you might implement an extension on the `String` class:
> ```dart
> extension NumberParsing on String {
>   int parseInt() {
>     return int.parse(this);
>   }
>
>   double parseDouble() {
>     return double.parse(this);
>   }
> }
> ```

> ```dart
> print('42'.parseInt());
> ```

- [Lasse Reichstein Holst Nielsen: Dart Extension Methods Fundamentals][12]
- [Dart Language Spec: Dart Static Extension Methods Design][13]




## Mixins

[Mixins][21] in [Dart] represent a way of defining code that can be reused in multiple class hierarchies.

> ```dart
> mixin Musical {
>   bool canPlayPiano = false;
>   bool canCompose = false;
>   bool canConduct = false;
>
>   void entertainMe() {
>     if (canPlayPiano) {
>       print('Playing piano');
>     } else if (canConduct) {
>       print('Waving hands');
>     } else {
>       print('Humming to self');
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

> ```dart
> class Maestro extends Person with Musical, Aggressive, Demented {
>   Maestro(String maestroName) {
>     name = maestroName;
>     canConduct = true;
>   }
> }
> ```

## Task

- [`task_1.dart`](task_1.dart): implement an extension on `DateTime`, returning a `String` in format of `YYYY.MM.DD hh:mm`.
- [`task_2.dart`](task_2.dart): implement an extension on `String`, parsing links from a text.
- [`task_3.dart`](task_3.dart): provide mixins describing equipable `Item`s by a `Character` type, implement the methods equipping them.




## Questions

After completing everything above, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:

### Extensions

**Why do you need to extend classes? Name some examples.**

Extensions allow you to add functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code or creating inheritance hierarchies. This is especially useful for:
- Adding utility methods to built-in types (e.g., `String`, `int`, `DateTime`)
- Enhancing third-party library classes
- Creating domain-specific APIs
- Examples: Adding parsing methods to `String`, date formatting to `DateTime`, validation methods to form inputs

**Can extension be private? Unnamed? Generic?**

- **Private**: Yes, extensions can be private by prefixing with underscore (`extension _PrivateExtension`)
- **Unnamed**: Yes, you can create unnamed extensions (`extension on String { ... }`)
- **Generic**: Yes, extensions can be generic (`extension<T> ListExtension<T> on List<T> { ... }`)

**How to resolve naming conflicts when multiple extensions define the same methods?**

Naming conflicts can be resolved by:
1. Using explicit extension syntax: `ExtensionName(object).method()`
2. Hiding conflicting extensions: `import 'library.dart' hide ConflictingExtension;`
3. Using prefixes: `import 'library.dart' as prefix;` then `prefix.ExtensionName(object).method()`
4. The closest extension in scope takes precedence (local > imported > exported)

### Mixins

**What is reasoning behind mixins? Why would you need them? Provide some examples.**

Mixins solve the "diamond problem" and enable horizontal code reuse across different class hierarchies:
- Share behavior between unrelated classes
- Compose functionality without deep inheritance
- Examples: `Flyable` mixin for birds and airplanes, `Serializable` for data persistence, `Loggable` for debugging capabilities

**Can you add static methods and/or fields to mixins?**

Yes, mixins can have static methods and fields:
```dart
mixin MyMixin {
  static const String staticField = 'value';
  static void staticMethod() { ... }
}
```

**`class`, `mixin`, or `mixin class`? What are differences? When to use each one?**

- **`class`**: Traditional inheritance, can be instantiated, single inheritance
- **`mixin`**: Cannot be instantiated, designed for composition, can be mixed into multiple classes
- **`mixin class`**: Can be used both as a class (instantiated, extended) and as a mixin, introduced in Dart 3.0

Use `class` for primary inheritance, `mixin` for shared behavior composition, and `mixin class` when you need both capabilities.
